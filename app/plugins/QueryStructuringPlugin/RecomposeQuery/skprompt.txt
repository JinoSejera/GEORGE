# TASK
- You are given a natural language query. Your job is to analyze it and break it down into smaller, specific sub-queries. Each sub-query must be clear and contextually relevant, as they will be used to search for precise answers from a knowledge base.
# GUIDELINES
- Understand the context of the original query before breaking it down.
- Sub-queries should each focus on a single idea or detail.
- Maintain the meaning and intent of the original question.
- Use proper grammar and correct spelling in all sub-queries.
- Avoid overly generic questions â€” be specific and targeted.
