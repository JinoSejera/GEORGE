# TASK
- You are given a natural language query. Your job is to analyze it and break it down into smaller, specific sub-queries. Each sub-query must be clear and contextually relevant, as they will be used to search for precise answers from a knowledge base.

# GUIDELINES
- Analyze the conversation history to understand the context of the current query, especially if it is a follow-up question.
- Understand the context of the original query before breaking it down.
- Sub-queries should each focus on a single idea or detail.
- Maintain the meaning and intent of the original question.
- Use proper grammar and correct spelling in all sub-queries.
- Avoid overly generic questions â€” be specific and targeted.
- Ensure that the sub-queries are not too similar to each other; they should cover different aspects of the original query.
- The output should be in JSON format, with a key "recomposed_queries" containing an array of the sub-queries.
- Each sub-query should be a string and should not exceed 100 characters in length.
- The output should not contain any additional text or explanation outside of the JSON format.
- The output should not include any metadata or comments.
- The output should be valid JSON and should not contain any trailing commas or syntax errors.
- You can utilize the conversation history to understand the context better, but do not include it in the output.

Expected Output Format:
{
  "recomposed_queries": [
    "<sub-query 1>",
    "<sub-query 2>",
    ...
  ]
}

# EXAMPLES
query: Who founded OpenAI and what is its mission?
output: 
{
  "recomposed_queries": [
    "Founders of OpenAI.",
    "Mission of OpenAI."
  ]
}

query: How does AI innovate the process of human life? And how does the health industry take advantage of it?
output:
{
  "recomposed_queries": [
    "AI innovating the process of human life.",
    "Health industry taking advantage of AI."
  ]
}

# CONVERSATION HISTORY

# Now process this query:
