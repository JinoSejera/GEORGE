Artists now use generative tools like Midjourney 6 and Adobe Firefly to co-create—key word there: co-create. These tools aren’t replacing designers; they’re expanding what’s possible. Writers use AI not to replace their voice but to explore different tones or build narrative arcs. And musicians are collaborating with AI to remix sounds that didn't even exist five years ago."

AI models trained on global medical data are detecting diseases earlier than ever—especially in regions with a shortage of medical professionals. In 2025, voice-based diagnostics are becoming more mainstream. Imagine a simple app that detects signs of Parkinson’s just from how you speak. That’s not science fiction. That’s happening now."

How do we keep biases out of large models? This year, we saw the first globally coordinated AI regulation effort with countries adopting parts of the AI Accord—a kind of Geneva Convention for machine intelligence. Transparency and auditability are no longer nice-to-haves—they’re mandatory."
